- In free time, I love collecting seeds, ecdyses, feathers, fallen flowers and leaves, and other natural products. Once I find something interesting, I would timely take it home, "dry-identify-label-save" it, and then register it in my [catalog (in Chinese, to be updated)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SGPsps8mkirtBDv8GJOwLPQV1bCysRX9/view?usp=sharing). When I was lucky enough to find an insect just dead, I would make an insect specimen.

- My total points of clouds collection: 125' (according to *[The Cloud Collector's Handbook](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=The+Cloud+Collector%27s+Handbook&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)*). Need to collect more!

- Number of identified wild bird species: 37 (To be updated). 12 in my [ebird](https://ebird.org/home?logout=true) checklist.

- Number of identified plant species: 247 (According to my checklist in Xingse App).

- I also take pictures to "collet" creeping caterpillar, twinkling stars, passing strangers, and more touching moments. Here are some pictures taken by me. Welcome to browse more at [500px](https://500px.com/zexixing0604) :D
