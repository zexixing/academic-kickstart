- In free time, I love collecting seeds, ecdyses, feathers, fallen flowers and leaves, and other natural products. Once I find something interesting, I would timely take it home, "identify-dry-label-save" it, and then register it in my [index (in Chinese)](https://zexixing.notion.site/Collection-Index-cb047e7ad84343989cb83bacdae8c900). When I was lucky enough to find an insect just dead, I would make an insect specimen.

- My total points of cloud collection: 125' (according to *[The Cloud Collector's Handbook](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=The+Cloud+Collector%27s+Handbook&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)*). Need to collect more!

- Number of observed wild bird species: [70 (click to see the list)](https://zexixing.notion.site/98cd402d74574aacbeb9aff1525f4147?v=5c751c255bc2484bac432ec0d592b876).

- Number of observed plant species: 247 (According to my checklist in Xingse App).

- I also take pictures to "collet" creeping caterpillar, twinkling stars, passing strangers, and more touching moments. Here are some pictures taken by me. Welcome to browse more at [500px website](https://500px.com/zexixing0604) :D
