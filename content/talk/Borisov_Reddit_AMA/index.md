We are the NASA, ALMA, and university scientists studying comets and asteroids, here to answer your questions about some of our more recent observations on [Comet Borisov](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/interstellar-comet-borisov-reveals-its-chemistry-and-possible-origins), Comet Atlas, and 1998 OR2. Ask us anything.

Join us at 4:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, April 28, to ask anything about these enigmatic objects zipping into our view. Is Comet Borisov really from outside our solar system? How does it compare to the other interstellar visitor ‘Oumuamua? What is it made of? What’s causing Comet Atlas to fall apart? How close is 1998 OR2 from Earth right now? We’d love to answer your questions about these, and more!
