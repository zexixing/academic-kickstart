I am a Ph.D. student in the department of physics at the [University of Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hong_Kong). My home is in Bazhou city, Hebei province in Mainland China. I have a general interest in physics, especially astrophysics, and currently focus on Ultraviolet and X-ray [observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_astronomy) of [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet) and [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid). Abundance, activities and history of the small bodies are intriguing for me. Space observatories, especially the [Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gehrels_Swift_Observatory), are my great friends. In 2018 I got my B.Sc. in astronomy from [Nanjing University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University), where many plane trees and cats live pretty happily.

In addition to research, I have extremely broad interests. I enjoy [nature and street photography](https://500px.com/zexixing0604), rope skipping and getting outdoors. I am a great fan of [G.E.M.](http://www.geteverybodymoving.com)'s music, [1 Million](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw8ZhLPdQ0u_Y-TLKd61hGA)'s dance and [MoMo&Hosea](https://www.instagram.com/xiaomoyuahou/)'s pictures. I love dogs, soy milk, and electronic products. I love my hometown, I love Beijing. **The big world fascinates me**.
