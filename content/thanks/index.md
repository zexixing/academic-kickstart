First, thank you very much to be interested in my work and browse my website.

On my life journey, there have been an inestimable number of people who ever helped, encouraged, and/or reasonably criticized me. They are a big part of my life and made me who I am. In order to sincerely thank them and remember their kindness as long as I can, I built this personal website on Apr. 2020, and enriched it with some academic progress afterwards.

Unfortunately, I received others' kindness so often that I can never list all the names, let alone many people helped me but I have never known. It is because of my omissions that I did not say thanks to them here, rather than what they did did not deserve appreciation. I apologize for this.

I really hope I can take these kindness as examples, and convey the kindness to more people.

<font face="rose" color="#A2A2A2">[2021-Nov-12] I did not update this page, and even the whole website from 2020-Apr-27 to 2021-Nov-12 because of the inconvenience of website deployment. I reorganized the frame these days and have made it more simple, and restarted to regularly update this page today.</font>

<font color="#A2A2A2">[2020-Apr-27]</font> **Dennis**, thank you for all of your encouragement, trust, patience, kindness, helpful guide and many others in my first paper, also for the whole duration since I planned to visit Auburn! We indeed did an excellent job! Cheers!

<font color="#A2A2A2">[2020-Apr-27]</font> **Jeanette** and **Scott**, thank you very sincerely for your huge effort, responsible carefulness and high efficiency for our [Swift-Borisov NASA media press](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-swift-mission-tallied-water-from-interstellar-comet-borisov)!
