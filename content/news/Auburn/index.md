I am very happy to join [Prof. Dennis Bodewits' research group](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~dzb0059/)! I am visiting Auburn University for eight months from 10/05/2019 to someday in May or June of 2020. During this period I am working on Swift observations of comets and asteroids. Dennis is an expert of small bodies' high energy study, and a super nice mentor!
