title: I joined Dennis Bodewits's group!
summary: \[2019-10 ~ 2020-05\] I am very happy to join [Prof. Dennis Bodewits' research group](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~dzb0059/)! I am visiting Auburn University for eight months from Oct. 2019 to May. 2020. During this period I am working on Swift observations of comets and asteroids. Dennis is an expert of small bodies' high energy study, and a super nice mentor!
